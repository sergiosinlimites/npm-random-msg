# random-messages

Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After doing a “git init” there is technically nothing there... This is a random message creator from a short list in JS.

## Install

```npm
npm install -g sergiosinlimites-random-messages
```

# Usage

```bash
random-msg
```
